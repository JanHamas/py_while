Standalone scripts refer to independent programs or files that can be executed on their own without requiring any additional context, frameworks, or dependencies to run. In the context of programming, particularly in Python, a standalone script typically:

Can Be Executed Directly: You can run it directly from the command line or terminal without needing to import it into another program.

Self-Contained: It includes all the necessary code to perform its intended function, including any required functions, logic, and variables.

Specific Functionality: Standalone scripts are usually designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks, such as data processing, automation, or utility functions.

Why Use Standalone Scripts?
Simplicity: They are easy to run and test.
Modularity: They can be used as part of larger systems or frameworks when needed, while still functioning independently.
Automation: They are often used for automating tasks that do not require user interaction.
In summary, standalone scripts are practical for running specific tasks quickly and easily without the overhead of a larger application or framework.
