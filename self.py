# In Python, self is a way to refer to the instance of the class itself when defining class methods. It allows you to access and modify the instance's attributes and methods within the class.
# Hereâ€™s a basic example:
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Here, self refers to the current instance of Dog

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Key Points:
# self represents the instance: When you create an instance (like my_dog = Dog("Buddy")), self in __init__ refers to my_dog.
# Accessing attributes: Using self.name, we set the name attribute of that specific instance.
# Required in instance methods: Every instance method must have self as the first parameter so Python knows to operate on that particular instance.
# When you call my_dog.bark(), self in bark refers to my_dog, so it can access my_dog.name.
