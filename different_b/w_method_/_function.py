In Python, **methods** and **functions** are similar in that they both represent blocks of code that perform a specific task. However, they have distinct differences, primarily in how they are used and where they are defined.

### 1. **Function**

A **function** is a block of reusable code defined with the `def` keyword and is **not bound to any object**. Functions can stand alone and are called independently. Here’s a simple example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Alice"))
```

In this example, `greet()` is a function. It can be called on its own without needing to be part of any class or object.

### 2. **Method**

A **method** is a function that is defined within a class and is **associated with an object**. Methods have access to the data contained in the class (via `self`), and they can operate on that data. Methods are called on objects (instances of classes), which is what makes them different from regular functions.

Here’s a simple example of a method within a class:

```python
class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):  # 'greet' is a method
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Creating an object of Greeter
greeter = Greeter()
# Calling the method
print(greeter.greet("Alice"))
```

In this example:
- `greet` is a **method** because it is defined within the `Greeter` class.
- It can only be called on an instance of `Greeter` (e.g., `greeter.greet("Alice")`).

### Key Differences Between Methods and Functions

| Aspect             | Function                       | Method                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Definition         | Defined outside of a class     | Defined inside a class                  |
| Bound to Object    | No                             | Yes                                     |
| Calling            | `function_name()`              | `object_name.method_name()`             |
| Access to Class Data | No, unless passed explicitly | Yes, through the `self` parameter       |

### Summary

- **Functions** are standalone and do not depend on any object.
- **Methods** are defined within classes, are associated with objects, and can access the object’s data.
