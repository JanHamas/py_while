''' 
It‚Äôs great that you want to dive into Python! You don't need to worry too much about your math skills, as most programming can be done with just basic math. However, 
if you‚Äôre interested in strengthening your math to support programming, here‚Äôs a gentle approach:

1. Brush Up on Basic Arithmetic and Algebra
Arithmetic: This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Basic Algebra: Learn about variables, basic equations, and solving for unknowns (e.g., 
ùë•
3
=
10
x+3=10).

# Key Tip:
# Don't stress over math‚Äîit‚Äôs more important to focus on logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Most programmers start with just the basics, and as you get more
# comfortable, you can always learn new math concepts if your projects require them.
